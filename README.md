# Language Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect the language of a given text. The aim is to build a robust and efficient language detection system using various machine learning techniques. The project is implemented and can be executed in Google Colab.

## Features
- Detects the language of a given text input.
- Supports multiple languages.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for high accuracy.
- Easy to use and integrate into other projects.
